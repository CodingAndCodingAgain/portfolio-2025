# CV 2025

This repository contains the code of my CV in 2025.

The main purpose of this small project was to make a CV website to provide alongside my LinkedIn profile.

Besides that, I wanted to play around some technologies and tools normal SaaS usually don't use, in this case:

- Three.JS ( 3D utilities core)
- React Three Fiber ( 3D utilities with React)
- GSAP ( for animations )
